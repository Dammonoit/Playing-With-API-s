# **Description.**
This repository is my experiment for learning purposes on some API's delivered by beautiful websites or rather companies i'd say  like Twitter , OpenWeather etc.
<br />

# **NASA API**
The objective of this API is to make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to application developers.

# **Tweepy API** 

Tweepy is open-sourced, hosted on GitHub and enables Python to communicate with Twitter platform and use its API.
Tweepy supports accessing Twitter via Basic Authentication and the newer method, OAuth. Twitter has stopped accepting Basic Authentication so OAuth is now the only way to use the Twitter API.
